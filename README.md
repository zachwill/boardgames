# boardgames

I wanted to find new boardgames to play, and I stumbled across this [great Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/board-games-database-from-boardgamegeek) from Jen Wadkins.

We only really enjoy a handful of games right now, so thought it'd be a fun simple problem to solve.
